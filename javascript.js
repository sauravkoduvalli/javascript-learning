/* What is Javascript? */

/*
    - A dynamic programming language primarily used for creating web pages.
    - It is a scripting language, meaning it is not needed to be compiled before execution. Instead, It's interpreted directly by the browser.

    Key features
    ------------
    1) Dynamic typing: varibales can store different data types without explicit declaration.
    2) Prototypal inheritance: Objects inherits properties and methods from other objects, providing a flexible object-oriented paradigm.
    3) First-class functions: functions can be treated as values, assigned to varibales, passed as arguments and returned from other functions.
    4) Event-driven programming: JS allows to create event handlers that responds to user interactions, such as click, mouse movements and keypress.
    5) Asynchronous programming: JS supports asynchronous operations enabling non-blocking execution and handling tasks like network requests and timeouts efficiently.

    Advantages
    ----------
    1) Client-side scripting: It can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
    2) Server-side scripting: Node.js allows you to build server-side applications with JS, enabling full-stack development.
    3) Cross-platform development: JS can be used to develop web, mobile, and desktop applications.
    4) Large and active community: A vast community provides extensive support, libraries, and frameworks.
    5) Easy to learn: JS has a relatively simple syntax and a gentle learning curve.

    Disadvantages
    ------------
    1) Browser compatibility: Different browser may interpret JS code in different ways, leading to compatibility issues.
    2) Single  threaded: JS is single threaded which can limit it's ability to handle complec tasks without blocking the user interface.
    
    Compilation Vs. Interpretation
    ------------------------------
    Compilation: 
        - The process of converting  or trandlating the JS code (human readablec code) into machine code before execution.
        - This process is typically faster but less flexible.
    Interpretation:
        - The process of executing the code line by line, without a prior compilation steps.
        - This approach is more flexible but can be slower in execution.
    
    JavaScript's Compilation Process
    --------------------------------
    - While JS is primarily an interpreted language, modern JS engines use a technique called Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to optimize performance. 
    - JIT compilers analyze and optimize JavaScript code during runtime, converting it into machine code for faster execution.
    - JS combines the flexibility of interpretation with the performance benefits of compilation, making it a powerful and versatile language for web development.
